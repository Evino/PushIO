* [NSUserNotification](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSUserNotification_Class/) framework is not supported in current version (6.29.0) of PushIO SDK. For iOS 10 notification support application must override following didReceiveRemoteNotification methods as:

```objective-c
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler
{
    [[PushIOManager sharedInstance] didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionResult:UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}

-(void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo{
    [[PushIOManager sharedInstance] didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
}
```
